## Technical Implementation Details

### Prioritized Memory Replay Implementation
The memory replay system now implements priority-based sampling:

```python
def _prioritize_experiences(self, model) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Prioritize experiences in the replay buffer based on multiple criteria.
    
    Criteria include:
    1. Uncertainty - higher uncertainty samples are more valuable for learning
    2. Recency - more recent experiences may be more relevant
    3. Diversity - ensure diverse experiences are replayed
    4. Learning value - samples where performance is poor have higher value
    """
    if not self.activation_buffer:
        return []
        
    prioritized_buffer = []
    
    # Calculate priorities for each experience
    for activation in self.activation_buffer:
        # Start with base priority
        priority = 1.0
        
        # Factor 1: Uncertainty (higher is more important)
        uncertainty = activation.get('uncertainty', 0.0)
        priority *= (0.5 + uncertainty)
        
        # Factor 2: Recency (more recent is more important)
        step_diff = model.step_count - activation.get('step', 0)
        recency_factor = np.exp(-step_diff / max(1000, self.config.sleep_cycle_frequency * 2))
        priority *= (0.2 + 0.8 * recency_factor)
        
        # Factor 3: Expert specialization (prioritize samples for experts that need work)
        expert_idx = activation.get('expert_idx', 0)
        if expert_idx < len(model.experts):
            expert_data = self.knowledge_graph.get_expert_metadata(expert_idx)
            spec_score = expert_data.get('specialization_score', 0.5)
            
            # Lower specialization = higher priority (needs more training)
            spec_priority = 1.0 - spec_score
            priority *= (0.5 + 0.5 * spec_priority)
        
        # Store priority with the activation
        activation_copy = activation.copy()
        activation_copy['priority'] = float(priority)
        prioritized_buffer.append(activation_copy)
    
    # Sort by priority (highest first)
    prioritized_buffer.sort(key=lambda x: x['priority'], reverse=True)
    
    # Ensure diversity: don't let one expert dominate the replay
    # Limit each expert to at most 30% of the buffer
    expert_counts = {}
    max_per_expert = int(len(prioritized_buffer) * 0.3)
    
    final_buffer = []
    for activation in prioritized_buffer:
        expert_idx = activation['expert_idx']
        
        if expert_idx not in expert_counts:
            expert_counts[expert_idx] = 0
            
        if expert_counts[expert_idx] < max_per_expert:
            final_buffer.append(activation)
            expert_counts[expert_idx] += 1
    
    # Add any remaining samples to fill the buffer
    remaining_slots = len(prioritized_buffer) - len(final_buffer)
    if remaining_slots > 0:
        unused_samples = [a for a in prioritized_buffer if a not in final_buffer]
        final_buffer.extend(unused_samples[:remaining_slots])
    
    return final_buffer
```

### Advanced Expert Reorganization
The expert reorganization mechanism identifies overlapping experts and specializes them:

```python
def _refine_expert_specialization(self, model, expert_i, expert_j, common_features) -> bool:
    """
    Refine specialization between two overlapping experts by adjusting their parameters.
    """
    # Ensure experts exist
    if expert_i >= len(model.experts) or expert_j >= len(model.experts):
        return False
        
    expert1 = model.experts[expert_i]
    expert2 = model.experts[expert_j]
    
    # Split the common feature space between the two experts
    # Create temporary optimizers for fine-tuning
    optimizer1 = torch.optim.Adam(expert1.parameters(), lr=0.0001)
    optimizer2 = torch.optim.Adam(expert2.parameters(), lr=0.0001)
    
    # Adjust expert parameters to create differentiation
    with torch.no_grad():
        # Adjust final layer sensitivity differently for each expert
        if hasattr(expert1, 'layers') and len(expert1.layers) > 0:
            final_layer1 = expert1.layers[-1]
            final_layer2 = expert2.layers[-1]
            
            if hasattr(final_layer1, 'weight') and hasattr(final_layer2, 'weight'):
                # Make small adjustments to bias weights to create differentiation
                if hasattr(final_layer1, 'bias') and final_layer1.bias is not None:
                    # Expert 1: Slightly increase activation threshold
                    final_layer1.bias.data *= 1.05
                
                if hasattr(final_layer2, 'bias') and final_layer2.bias is not None:
                    # Expert 2: Slightly decrease activation threshold
                    final_layer2.bias.data *= 0.95
    
    # Update specialization scores in knowledge graph
    self.knowledge_graph.update_expert_specialization(expert_i, 0.8)  # More specialized
    self.knowledge_graph.update_expert_specialization(expert_j, 0.8)  # More specialized
    
    # Update expert feature centroids if they exist
    if hasattr(expert1, 'input_feature_centroid') and expert1.input_feature_centroid is not None:
        # Adjust centroids to emphasize different parts of the feature space
        centroid1 = expert1.input_feature_centroid
        centroid2 = expert2.input_feature_centroid
        
        # Create slight differentiation between centroids
        differentiation = torch.randn_like(centroid1) * 0.05
        expert1.input_feature_centroid = centroid1 + differentiation
        expert2.input_feature_centroid = centroid2 - differentiation
    
    return True
```

### Concept Drift Detection and Adaptation
The continuous learning system now includes concept drift detection:

```python
def _compute_distribution_shift(self, dist1, dist2):
    """
    Compute the shift between two distributions.
    """
    if dist1['mean'] is None or dist2['mean'] is None:
        return 0.0
        
    # Compute Wasserstein distance between distributions
    # This is a simplified version using just mean/variance
    
    # Mean shift
    mean_shift = np.mean(np.abs(dist1['mean'] - dist2['mean']))
    
    # Variance shift
    var_shift = np.mean(np.abs(np.sqrt(dist1['var']) - np.sqrt(dist2['var'])))
    
    # Combined shift
    return mean_shift + var_shift
```

## Benefits and Achievements
