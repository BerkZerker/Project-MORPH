# MORPH Phase 4: Sleep Function Implementation

## Overview
Phase 4 represents the final and most innovative component of the MORPH system: implementing a brain-inspired sleep function for knowledge consolidation. After successfully completing Phases 1-3 (basic MoE, adaptive expert creation, and expert merging/pruning), this phase will focus on creating an advanced memory replay system during "sleep cycles" to optimize the expert network structure.

- [ ] Develop metrics for catastrophic forgetting measurement
- [ ] Build visualization tools for expert specialization over time

## Technical Implementation Details

### Memory Replay Implementation
The memory replay system will extend the current activation buffer to store more metadata:

```python
def collect_activation(self, expert_idx, inputs, outputs, routing_weight, target=None):
    """Store activation for later replay during sleep."""
    if len(self.activation_buffer) >= self.buffer_size:
        # Replace oldest items first (or use prioritized buffer later)
        self.activation_buffer.pop(0)
        
    self.activation_buffer.append({
        'expert_idx': expert_idx,
        'inputs': inputs.detach().cpu(),
        'outputs': outputs.detach().cpu(),
        'routing_weight': routing_weight,
        'timestamp': self.step_count,
        'target': target.detach().cpu() if target is not None else None,
        'uncertainty': self._compute_uncertainty_for_input(inputs)
    })
```

### Sleep Cycle Memory Replay
During sleep cycles, the system will replay stored activations to reinforce learning:

```python
def _replay_memory(self):
    """Replay stored activations during sleep."""
    if not self.activation_buffer:
        return
    
    # Select most important experiences to replay
    experiences = self._prioritize_experiences()
    
    # Group by expert for efficient batch processing
    expert_experiences = self._group_by_expert(experiences)
    
    # Replay for each expert
    for expert_idx, expert_data in expert_experiences.items():
        if expert_idx >= len(self.experts):
            continue  # Expert may have been pruned
        
        inputs = torch.cat([e['inputs'] for e in expert_data])
        targets = torch.cat([e['target'] for e in expert_data if e['target'] is not None])
        
        # Replay through specific expert
        with torch.no_grad():
            self.experts[expert_idx].replay_activations(inputs, targets)
```

## Milestones and Schedule

## Expected Benefits

- **Reduced Catastrophic Forgetting**: Memory replay will help preserve knowledge of previous tasks
- **Improved Specialization**: Experts will develop clearer specialization through targeted replay
- **Resource Efficiency**: Expert reorganization will optimize model structure during sleep
- **Continual Learning**: The system will adapt more effectively to changing data distributions
- **Knowledge Consolidation**: Similar patterns across experts will be consolidated during sleep

## Open Research Questions

1. What is the optimal memory replay strategy (uniform, prioritized, curriculum-based)?
2. How to balance expert specialization vs. generalization during reorganization?
3. What mechanisms are most effective for detecting and adapting to concept drift?
4. How can the knowledge graph structure be optimized during sleep?
5. What metrics best capture the benefits of sleep-based consolidation?

## Next Immediate Tasks

2. Create expert-specific replay mechanism
3. Develop expert parameter fine-tuning during sleep
4. Implement basic meta-learning for uncertainty thresholds
5. Update visualization tools to show sleep cycle effects
