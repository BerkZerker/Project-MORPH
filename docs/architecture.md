# Architecture

## Overview

This framework implements an advanced neural network architecture that implements a dynamic Mixture of Experts (MoE) model with continuous learning capabilities. The system features adaptive expert creation, brain-inspired post-processing mechanisms, and a knowledge graph for intelligent routing.

## Core Components

### Model

The main model class that orchestrates all components. It manages the flow of information between the gating network, experts, knowledge graph, and sleep module.

Key responsibilities:
- Forward pass routing through experts
- Expert creation and management
- Step counting and sleep cycle triggering
- Integration of all components

### Expert

Individual neural networks that specialize in particular subtasks or data distributions. Each expert tracks its own activations, specialization metrics, and activation history.

Features:
- Customizable neural network architecture
- Activation tracking
- Specialization metrics
- Input feature tracking
- Performance history

### GatingNetwork

Routes inputs to the most appropriate experts based on input features. It determines the expert selection and uncertainty levels that drive dynamic expert creation.

Features:
- Top-k routing mechanism
- Uncertainty calculation
- Dynamic expert creation signaling

### KnowledgeGraph

Represents relationships between experts and concept domains. This component tracks expert similarities, specializations, and knowledge dependencies.

Features:
- Expert relationship tracking
- Concept embedding storage
- Similarity computation
- Edge weight decay
- Specialization tracking

### SleepModule

Handles periodic knowledge consolidation through memory replay, expert merging, and reorganization. This is inspired by how biological brains consolidate memories during sleep.

Features:
- Memory replay system
- Expert merging and pruning
- Knowledge reorganization
- Adaptive sleep scheduling
- Meta-learning optimization

## Data Flow

1. **Input Processing**: Inputs pass through the gating network
2. **Expert Selection**: Gating network selects the most appropriate experts
3. **Expert Processing**: Selected experts process the inputs
4. **Output Combination**: Expert outputs are combined using gating weights
5. **Tracking**: Activation patterns are stored for later consolidation
6. **Sleep Process**: At intervals, the sleep module consolidates knowledge

## Sleep Cycle

The sleep cycle is a critical part of the framework that handles knowledge consolidation:

1. **Memory Replay**: Stored activations are replayed to fine-tune experts
2. **Expert Analysis**: Expert specializations are analyzed and updated
3. **Expert Merging**: Similar experts are merged to reduce redundancy
4. **Expert Pruning**: Dormant experts are removed to optimize resources
5. **Knowledge Reorganization**: Expert relationships are adjusted based on activations
6. **Meta-Learning**: Model hyperparameters are optimized based on performance

## Configuration

The Config class provides configuration options for all aspects of the model:

- Expert count and architecture
- Dynamic expert creation settings
- Sleep cycle parameters
- Knowledge graph settings
- Training parameters

## Design Patterns

The framework uses several key design patterns:

1. **Modularity**: Components are decoupled with clear responsibilities
2. **Dynamic Creation**: Experts are created at runtime based on need
3. **Self-Optimization**: The model adjusts its own structure during sleep
4. **Memory Consolidation**: Similar to biological systems, knowledge is consolidated periodically
5. **Meta-Learning**: The model learns to improve its own learning process

## Advanced Features

### Continuous Learning

The framework is designed for continuous learning scenarios where data distributions change over time. The architecture prevents catastrophic forgetting through:

- Expert specialization
- Selective updates
- Memory replay
- Knowledge graph tracking

### Concept-Based Routing

The knowledge graph can link experts to specific concepts, enabling more intelligent routing based on semantic understanding rather than just pattern matching.

### Meta-Learning Optimization

During sleep cycles, the model can optimize its own hyperparameters based on performance metrics, adapting to changing data conditions.
