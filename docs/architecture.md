# MORPH Architecture Design

## System Overview

MORPH (Mixture Of experts with Recursive Post-processing & Hierarchy) is a novel neural network architecture that dynamically adapts to new data distributions through several key mechanisms:

1. **Dynamic Mixture of Experts (MoE)**: A framework where multiple specialized neural networks (experts) collaboratively solve tasks
2. **Adaptive Expert Creation**: Automatic generation of new experts when existing ones underperform
3. **Knowledge Graph Routing**: Expert selection based on semantic relationships rather than fixed gates
4. **Sleep Cycle Consolidation**: Periodic optimization of the expert pool via merging and pruning

## Core Components

### Expert Networks

Each expert in MORPH is a specialized neural network designed to handle specific input patterns:

```
Expert Structure:
- Input Layer (size configurable)
- Hidden Layers (customizable depth and width)
- Output Layer (size configurable)
- Activation metadata (utilization tracking)
```

Experts maintain statistics about their usage and activation patterns, which inform the sleep cycle's consolidation decisions.

### Gating Network

The gating network routes inputs to the most appropriate experts:

```
Gating Network Structure:
- Input Embedding Layer
- Hidden Layer
- Output Layer (produces expert selection probabilities)
```

The gating network uses uncertainty estimates to trigger new expert creation when no existing expert can confidently handle an input.

### Knowledge Graph

The knowledge graph tracks conceptual relationships between experts:

```
Knowledge Graph Structure:
- Nodes: Individual experts
- Edges: Similarity/relationship strengths between experts
- Metadata: Activation statistics, specialization domains
```

This graph structure helps with routing decisions and expert consolidation during sleep cycles.

### Sleep Module

The sleep module performs periodic optimization of the expert pool:

```
Sleep Cycle Operations:
1. Memory Replay: Revisit stored activations
2. Expert Similarity Analysis: Compute pair-wise expert similarities
3. Expert Merging: Combine redundant experts
4. Expert Pruning: Remove dormant or underutilized experts
5. Knowledge Graph Reorganization: Update the graph structure
```

## Data Flow

The typical data flow through the MORPH system follows these steps:

1. Input data arrives at the gating network
2. Gating network computes routing probabilities for experts
3. Top-k experts are selected and activated
4. Each expert processes the input independently
5. Outputs are combined according to routing weights
6. During training, uncertainty is measured
7. If uncertainty is high, a new expert may be created
8. Periodically, the sleep cycle optimizes the experts

## Implementation Details

### Forward Pass

```python
# Pseudocode for forward pass
def forward(x, training=True):
    # Get routing weights
    routing_weights, expert_indices, uncertainty = gating_network(x)
    
    # Maybe create new expert if uncertainty is high and in training mode
    if training and uncertainty > threshold:
        create_new_expert()
    
    # Initialize output
    outputs = zeros_like(x.shape[0], output_size)
    
    # Route through experts
    for i in range(k_experts):
        indices = expert_indices[:, i]
        weights = routing_weights[:, i]
        
        for expert_idx in unique(indices):
            mask = (indices == expert_idx)
            expert_inputs = x[mask]
            expert_outputs = experts[expert_idx](expert_inputs)
            outputs[mask] += expert_outputs * weights[mask]
    
    return outputs
```

### Sleep Cycle

```python
# Pseudocode for sleep cycle
def sleep():
    # 1. Memory replay
    replay_stored_activations()
    
    # 2. Find experts to merge
    similar_experts = find_similar_experts()
    for i, j in similar_experts:
        merge_experts(i, j)
    
    # 3. Find experts to prune
    dormant_experts = find_dormant_experts()
    for i in dormant_experts:
        prune_expert(i)
    
    # 4. Update knowledge graph
    update_knowledge_graph()
```

## Scalability Considerations

As the number of experts grows, several optimizations maintain efficiency:

- Sparse activation ensures only a small subset of experts process each input
- The knowledge graph enables efficient expert selection
- The sleep cycle prevents unbounded growth of experts
- Expert similarity computations can be periodically scheduled rather than computed continuously
