# Project-MORPH Refactoring Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for refactoring large files in the Project-MORPH codebase into smaller, more modular components. The focus is on improving encapsulation, readability, and maintainability while preserving functionality.

## Identified Large Files

Based on line count analysis, the following files have been identified as candidates for refactoring:

1. `morph/utils/benchmarks/benchmark.py` (664 lines)
2. `morph/core/sleep.py` (581 lines)
3. `morph/core/model.py` (464 lines)
4. `morph/core/knowledge_graph.py` (441 lines)
5. `morph/utils/distributed.py` (370 lines)

## General Refactoring Approach

For each file, we will:

1. Analyze the current structure and responsibilities
2. Identify logical components that can be separated
3. Design a modular structure with clear interfaces
4. Outline specific refactoring steps
5. Ensure backward compatibility

## 1. Refactoring `morph/utils/benchmarks/benchmark.py` (COMPLETED)

### Current Structure
The file contains a `ContinualLearningBenchmark` class with methods for training, evaluating, and measuring continual learning performance. It handles multiple responsibilities including training, evaluation, drift detection, and expert utilization metrics.

### Proposed Modular Structure

```
morph/utils/benchmarks/
├── benchmark.py (thin interface)
├── core/
│   └── benchmark_base.py (core benchmark class)
├── training/
│   └── benchmark_training.py (training logic)
├── evaluation/
│   └── benchmark_evaluation.py (evaluation logic)
├── drift/
│   └── benchmark_drift.py (drift detection)
└── expert/
    └── benchmark_expert.py (expert utilization)
```

### Specific Refactoring Steps

1. **Create `benchmark_base.py`**
   - Move the `ContinualLearningBenchmark` class initialization
   - Keep core attributes and simple utility methods
   - Estimated size: ~100 lines

2. **Create `benchmark_training.py`**
   - Extract `train_model` method and related helpers
   - Include training-specific utility functions
   - Estimated size: ~200 lines

3. **Create `benchmark_evaluation.py`**
   - Extract `evaluate_model` and `run_benchmark` methods
   - Include evaluation-specific utility functions
   - Estimated size: ~150 lines

4. **Create `benchmark_drift.py`**

     - `_compute_feature_distribution`
     - `_compute_distribution_shift`
     - `_compute_adaptation_rate`
     - `calculate_concept_drift_metrics`
   - Estimated size: ~100 lines

5. **Create `benchmark_expert.py`**
   - Extract expert utilization methods:
     - `calculate_expert_utilization_metrics`
   - Include expert tracking logic
   - Estimated size: ~80 lines

6. **Update `benchmark.py`**
   - Convert to a thin interface that imports and delegates to the new modules
   - Maintain backward compatibility
   - Estimated size: ~50 lines

### Interface Design

```python
# benchmark.py (thin interface)
from morph.utils.benchmarks.core.benchmark_base import BenchmarkBase
from morph.utils.benchmarks.training.benchmark_training import BenchmarkTraining
from morph.utils.benchmarks.evaluation.benchmark_evaluation import BenchmarkEvaluation
from morph.utils.benchmarks.drift.benchmark_drift import BenchmarkDrift
from morph.utils.benchmarks.expert.benchmark_expert import BenchmarkExpert

class ContinualLearningBenchmark(BenchmarkBase, BenchmarkTraining, BenchmarkEvaluation, 
                                BenchmarkDrift, BenchmarkExpert):
    """
    Benchmark for comparing continual learning performance of different models.
    
    This class provides tools to:
    1. Set up sequential tasks with distribution shifts
    2. Train and evaluate models on these tasks
    3. Measure catastrophic forgetting and other continual learning metrics
    4. Compare MORPH with standard models and other continual learning approaches
    5. Detect concept drift and measure adaptation
    6. Evaluate knowledge transfer between related tasks
    """

## Implementation Strategy

For each file refactoring:

1. **Create New Modules**: Establish new files with appropriate imports
2. **Move Methods**: Extract methods into appropriate modules
3. **Establish Interface**: Create clear interfaces between modules
4. **Update Imports**: Update import statements across the codebase
5. **Test**: Ensure functionality remains intact

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Update unit tests to reflect the new structure
2. **Integration Tests**: Ensure components work together correctly
3. **Regression Tests**: Verify that refactored code produces the same results as the original

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Improved Readability**: Smaller files with focused responsibility
2. **Better Encapsulation**: Clearer boundaries between different concerns
3. **Simplified Maintenance**: Changes to one aspect don't require modifying large files
4. **Easier Collaboration**: Team members can work on different modules without conflicts
5. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Developers can understand one aspect at a time

## Timeline and Prioritization

1. **Phase 1**: Refactor `morph/utils/benchmarks/benchmark.py` (highest priority due to size)
2. **Phase 2**: Refactor `morph/core/sleep.py` and `morph/core/model.py`
3. **Phase 3**: Refactor `morph/core/knowledge_graph.py`
4. **Phase 4**: Refactor `morph/utils/distributed.py`

Each phase should include:
- Implementation of the refactoring
- Testing to ensure functionality is preserved
- Documentation updates
- Code review

## Completion Status
