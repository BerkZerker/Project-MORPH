   - Create adversarial examples to test robustness
   - Benchmark against established text processing baselines

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a detailed roadmap for refocusing Project-MORPH on text processing applications. The plan prioritizes cleaning up vision-related code first, then building the text-specific functionality from the ground up. The critical path focuses on establishing the core text functionality, while medium and long-term tasks build increasingly sophisticated capabilities on this foundation.

By following this plan, we will create a powerful text processing system that leverages the advantages of dynamic Mixture of Experts architecture, with capabilities for continual learning, domain adaptation, and knowledge consolidation through its sleep mechanism.
