# MORPH Project Implementation Plan

## Project Phases & Milestones

### Phase 1: Basic MoE Implementation (Foundation)
- **Goal**: Create a functional Mixture of Experts system with standard gating mechanism
- **Tasks**:
  1. Implement individual expert networks (small transformer blocks or MLPs)
  2. Build basic gating network for expert selection
  3. Create sparse activation mechanism with top-k routing
  4. Implement forward/backward pass handling with selective expert training
  5. Build evaluation framework to measure expert specialization
  6. Test on small datasets (e.g., MNIST, small text corpus)
- **Deliverables**: Working MoE model with fixed set of experts

### Phase 2: Adaptive Expert Creation
- **Goal**: Enable dynamic expert creation when existing experts underperform
- **Tasks**:
  1. Implement uncertainty metrics to identify insufficient expert coverage
  2. Create expert initialization mechanism (from scratch or cloning)
  3. Build basic knowledge graph to track conceptual relationships
  4. Develop semantic similarity routing based on input embeddings
  5. Test with gradually introduced novel data
- **Deliverables**: Dynamic MoE that grows new experts as needed

### Phase 3: Expert Merging & Pruning
- **Goal**: Optimize expert count through consolidation and removal
- **Tasks**:
  1. Implement similarity metrics between experts (weight space, activation patterns)
  2. Create expert merging algorithm that preserves knowledge
  3. Build dormant expert detection and pruning mechanism
  4. Design expert utilization tracking system
  5. Test with intentionally redundant experts
- **Deliverables**: Self-optimizing network that maintains efficient expert count

### Phase 4: Sleep Function Implementation
- **Goal**: Create periodic post-processing for knowledge consolidation
- **Tasks**:
  1. Implement memory replay system using stored activations
  2. Build expert reorganization mechanism based on activation patterns
  3. Create meta-learning optimization for expert management
  4. Implement scheduler for sleep phase triggering
  5. Test with long-running continuous learning scenarios
- **Deliverables**: Complete MORPH system with all components functioning
